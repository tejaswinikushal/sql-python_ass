    "A database is a structured collection of data that is organized, stored, and managed in a way that allows for efficient retrieval, manipulation, and analysis of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL (Structured Query Language) and NoSQL (Not Only SQL) are two different types of database management systems that differ in their data models, query languages, and scalability options.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Differences :\n",
    "\n",
    "1.Data Model: SQL databases follow a fixed schema with predefined tables and relationships, whereas NoSQL databases have a flexible schema that allows for dynamic and unstructured data.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.Query Language: SQL databases use SQL as the query language, which provides a standardized way to interact with the data. NoSQL databases have their own query languages, which vary depending on the database type (e.g., MongoDB uses a JSON-based query language).\n",
    "\n",
    "3.ACID Properties: SQL databases generally support ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) properties, ensuring data integrity and transactional consistency. NoSQL databases often relax some of these properties in favor of performance and scalability.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.Data Relationships: SQL databases are well-suited for handling complex relationships between data entities through the use of foreign keys and join operations. NoSQL databases handle relationships differently depending on the data model, often denormalizing or embedding related data within a single document or record.MongoDB uses a JSON-based query language).\n"
